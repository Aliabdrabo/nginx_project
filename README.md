## Overview 📌

This project demonstrates a production-style Nginx reverse proxy architecture on AWS, where Nginx acts as a single entry point that securely routes traffic to multiple private backend services with load balancing, rate limiting, and failover.

The setup follows best practices by isolating backend services in a private subnet and allowing access only through Nginx.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Nginx EC2 instance in a public subnet
- Two Flask backend servers in a private subnet
- Security Groups to restrict traffic flow
- Rate limiting & connection limiting enforced at Nginx level
- Passive health checks & failover using Nginx upstream configuration

## How to Run

1. **Start the backends**
 ssh into the ec2 insteance
<img width="1655" height="831" alt="sshintonginx" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a488483-1641-43ab-9f17-3d6c20c475be" />
```bash
cd backend/
python3 app.py
```

2. Place SSL certificate and key in the ssl/ folder (or use your own paths).

4. Copy Nginx config and enable site:
```bash
sudo cp nginx/project.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/nginx_project.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/project.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Load Balancing Demonstration
Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy with an upstream backend pool to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers.

The following screenshots demonstrate that load balancing is working correctly:
- Each backend server (Backend 1 and Backend 2) is running a Flask application on a different EC2 instance.
- Incoming client requests are forwarded by Nginx to the backends in a round-robin manner.
- The backend logs show successful HTTP `200` responses for requests originating from the Nginx server’s private IP.
- Requests are distributed across both backends, confirming that Nginx is actively balancing the load instead of routing traffic to a single server.

This setup improves availability and scalability by preventing a single backend from becoming a bottleneck.

## 🔁 Traffic Flow

1. Client sends HTTP/HTTPS requests from the Internet.
2. Traffic enters the VPC through the Internet Gateway.
3. Requests reach the Nginx Reverse Proxy EC2 in the public subnet.
4. Nginx:
   - Terminates HTTPS
   - Applies rate limiting and connection limiting
   - Forwards requests to backend servers using round-robin load balancing
5. Requests are forwarded to private backend EC2 instances.
6. Backends respond to Nginx, which then returns the response to the client.

## ❤️ Health Checks & Failover

- Nginx performs **passive health checks**.
- If a backend fails to respond:
  - It is temporarily removed from the upstream pool.
  - Traffic is automatically routed to the healthy backend.
- This ensures **high availability** without client-side impact.

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Connection Limiting

- Implemented at the Nginx layer to protect backend services:
- Rate limiting per client IP
- Connection limiting to prevent abuse and DoS-like behavior
- Helps ensure fair usage and backend stability


## 🔐 Security Design

### Network Isolation
- Backend servers are deployed in a **private subnet**.
- No direct Internet access to backend instances.

### Security Groups

#### Nginx Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic on **ports 80 and 443** from the Internet.

#### Backend Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic **only from the Nginx Security Group**.
- Backend ports:
  - **8081** for Backend 1
  - **8082** for Backend 2
